\usage{
fdr_mCP(
  corum_database,
  experiment_data,
  N_fractions = 35,
  specie = "hsapiens",
  filter = 0.93,
  n_simulations = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{corum_database}{The corum data base.}

\item{experiment_data}{A matrix that has protein_id in the first column and the detected intensities in the other colums.}

\item{N_fractions}{Number of fractions in your experimet}

\item{specie}{Write: "hsapiens" if you work with homosapiens.}

\item{filter}{Pearson Correlation filter for the analysis}

\item{n_simulations}{number of simulations 10 by default}
}
\description{
This function performs different matrix from your experimental matrix and evaluetes this "fake matrix" into  mCP workflow by using the selected filter then calculates the FDR based in montecarlo simulations and the real result of protein complexes detected in your experiment.
