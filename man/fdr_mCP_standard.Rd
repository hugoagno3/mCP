}
\arguments{
\item{corum_database}{The corum data base.}

\item{experiment_data}{A matrix that has protein_id in the first column and the detected intensities in the other colums.}

\item{N_fractions}{Number of fractions in your experimet}

\item{specie}{Write: "hsapiens" if you work with homosapiens.}

\item{filter}{Pearson Correlation filter for the analysis}

\item{n_simulations}{number of simulations 10 by default}

\item{Output_cpp_plotter}{output list of detected protein complexes function cpp_plotter}

\item{file_name}{this is the file name of the output, is a string, It should be writen within "". For example "outputname"}

\item{save_file}{could be TRUE or FALSE it generate an csv file with results of Fold Discovery Rate per protein complexes}

\item{Risk_fraction}{is a number indicating the fraction where all monomeric components of the protein complex should be present. It is set to 85\% of the n_fraction.}

\item{monomeric_filter}{a TRUE or FALSE setting that takes out potential protein complexes sie a hight porcentaje of monomeric conformation. This is related to the previous filter by defoult is off so the user can decide.}

\item{set_seed}{a TRUE or FALSE setting to standarise simulations.}
}
\value{
a list of controlled FDr Portein compleses.
}
\description{
This function performs different matrix from your experimental matrix and evaluates this "fake matrix" into  mCP workflow by using the selected filter then calculates the FDR based in Montecarlo Simulations (under assumption of independence of correlation coefficient) and the real result of protein complexes detected in your experiment.
