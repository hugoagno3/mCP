\title{mCP function: Targeted analysis of protein complexes extended to a low number of fractions.}
\usage{
mCP(
  corum_database,
  experiment_data,
  N_fractions = 35,
  specie = "hsapiens",
  method_cor = "pearson",
  heatmap_seaborn = TRUE,
  format = "pdf",
  output_name = mCP_analysis,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{corum_database}{a data.frame with 3 columns: first "complex_id", "complex_name" and "protein_id"}

\item{experiment_data}{A \emph{data.frame} with your experiment results in wide-format- first column called "protein_id" and the next columns numerics names from 1 to number of fractions.}

\item{N_fractions}{number of protein fractions obtained in the co-fractionation experiment.}

\item{specie}{= could be "mmusculus", "hsapiens" , check gconvert vignette for more options (gprofiler2 package) https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gprofiler2/vignettes/gprofiler2.html}

\item{method_cor}{= can be "kendall", "spearman" or "pearson" (default "pearson")}

\item{heatmap_seaborn}{always TRUE perform a correlation matrix compatible with the heat map seaborn form corrr package. Not active only in the FDR function.}

\item{format}{should be "pdf" to plots pdf. There is an additional possible value is ".": this will omit pdf. In both cases the user will have a list of plot for the detected protein complexes in R.}

\item{output_name}{main core name for the files to be printed, it is a string: see example.}

\item{filter}{targeted value of minimum accepted binary interaction hits between 2 proteins within a protein complex (we recomend a 0.93 value).}

\item{heat_map}{a TRUE or FALSE statement to plot heatmaps.}

\item{display_weights}{TRUE or FALSE statement to display molecular weight markers in the complexome profiling plots.}

\item{standard_weights}{following core= list(list(x =11, label= "1049KDa"), list(x = 13, label ="720 KDa"))). It is possible to add many markers. you have to extend the code, for example to add a thrid marker= list(list(x =11, label= "1049KDa"), list(x=12, label="900 kDa"), list(x = 13, label ="720 KDa"))). Display_weights muss be TRUE}

\item{fdr_limit}{report only protein complexes detected with a false discovery rate lower than a numeric value, for example = 0.05.}

\item{n_simulations}{This is the number of simulations we recomend 185 simulations (this part could take 12 hrs for human dataset).}

\item{Risk_fraction}{is a number indicating the fraction where all monomeric components of the protein complex should be present. It is set to 85\% of the n_fraction.}

\item{monomeric_filter}{a TRUE or FALSE setting that takes out potential protein complexes sie a hight porcentaje of monomeric conformation. This is related to the previous filter by defoult is off so the user can decide.}

\item{set_seed}{a TRUE or FALSE setting to standarise simulations.}

\item{mw}{TRUE or FALSE setting plot moleculare weight (requires std weights in kDa).}

\item{relativea}{TRUE or FALSE statement to plot relative complexome profiling plots, useful to compare between conditions.}
}
\value{
a list of protein complexes plots, the significant interactions, binary pairs proteins detected, and a network heatmap based.
}
\description{
This function is an integrated function of mCP package, that needs as input an experimental data and returns a list of plots, binary total hits, id of proteins of binary hits and heatmaps_seaborn of know protein complexes detected in CORUM database. In addition, it plots 4 files as  outputs:
1- pdf file with detected protein complexes profiles from Corum database.
2- pdf with heatmaps of the detected protein complexes.
3- txt file with numbers about general false positive when just 1 hit is consider as filter.
4- CVS file containing all protein complexes detected, hits of binary interactions inside the protein complexes, FDR detected by MonteCarloSimulation.
