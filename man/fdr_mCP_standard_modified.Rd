\arguments{
\item{corum_database}{The corum data base.}

\item{experiment_data}{A matrix that has protein_id in the first column and the detected intensities in the other colums.}

\item{N_fractions}{Number of fractions in your experimet}

\item{specie}{Write: "hsapiens" if you work with homosapiens.}

\item{filter}{Pearson Correlation filter for the analysis}

\item{n_simulations}{number of simulations 10 by default}

\item{Output_cpp_plotter}{output list of detected protein complexes function cpp_plotter}

\item{file_name}{this is the file name of the output, is a string, It should be writen within "". For example "outputname"}

\item{save_file}{could be TRUE or FALSE it generate an csv file with results of Fold Discovery Rate per protein complexes}

\item{Risk_fraction}{is a number indicating the fraction where all monomeric components of the protein complex should be present. It is set to 85\% of the n_fraction (when the experiment is performed from high molecular weight to low molecular weight).}

\item{monomeric_filter}{a TRUE or FALSE setting that takes out potential protein complexes site a hight porcentaje of monomeric conformation. This is related to the previous filter by defoult is off so the user can decide.}

\item{set_seed}{a TRUE or FALSE setting to standarise simulations.}
}
\value{
a list of controlled FDr Portein compleses.

\description{
This function needs as inputs a list of complexes outputs generates by mCP() or cpp_ploter, the experimental matrix and a Target list of protein complexes (CORUM or complex portal adapted). It  performs an FDR calculation based in Montecarlo Simulations (under assumption of independence of correlation coefficient). It performs two different set of sumulation to test connectivity (number of hit that correlates) and average of pearson correlations hits. Decoys are generated from the experimental matrix, then it evaluates this "fake matrix" into  mCP workflow by using an open filter to ensure decoys comparison, then it takes the pearson hits according to the first filter.ent.
